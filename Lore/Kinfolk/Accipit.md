# Accipit
The **Accipit** are a species of "True Hawk" residing in the Northern areas of Talba's Rise.

### Appearance
- **Average Height:** Between **3-5ft** tall (excluding tail)
- **Description:** Accipiteri are based on the true hawks of reality, such as the Goshawk. 

### Behaviour
Accipiteri are solitary and stoic people, and fiercely guard their homeland. They often clash with the far more boisterous false hawks, Buteiteri.
Accipiteri sometimes rescue passing caravans from the Buteit, launching a conflict that spins and swirls overhead.
